# DRF Online Shop

## Description
A personal project built as a base backend for future e-commerce applications. The project uses Django REST Framework (DRF) and JWT authentication for secure, password-less OTP-based user login. While most of the models have been implemented, CRUD operations have been completed only for specific apps like user accounts and comments. Some features like orders, products, and payment systems are yet to be finished.

## Features
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure and password-less login using JSON Web Tokens.
- **OTP Authentication**: One-time password-based authentication for added security.
- **User Accounts CRUD**: Basic functionality for user registration, login, and profile management.
- **Comments CRUD**: Manage comments for products or services.
- **Model-based CRUD Operations**: Automated CRUD views for multiple apps.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (Django Framework)
- **Django REST Framework** (DRF) for building APIs
- **JWT Authentication** for secure, token-based login
- **OTP Authentication** for password-less user authentication
- **Generic Relationships** for enhanced model linking
